# Design-of-a-Secure-Healthcare-System


I have designed a secure healthcare system that aims to protect patient data and the system itself from unauthorized access or attacks. The system's use cases include patient care and communication between patients and the clinic.

To begin with, my team and I identified the need for a security policy that outlines the security requirements. The policy mandates that the system must be available during operational hours and offline only during maintenance hours. The system must not disclose patient data to unauthorized parties or violate patient data privacy.

Furthermore, the system must control employee access to critical use cases. Only a nurse or doctor can access the Record Visit use case, and only a doctor can access the Treat Patient use case. We have also identified additional threats to the system and provided security measures to mitigate these threats.

In conclusion, my team and I have designed a secure healthcare system that meets the security policy's requirements and safeguards patient data and the system from potential threats or attacks.
